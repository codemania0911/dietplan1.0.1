 THEMEFOREST CHEK FIXES REVIEW

 1. Site icon is provided by WP 4.3, you can use function_exist('wp_site_icon') for backward compatibility.

 2. Please provide detailed item description. After editing, click save, resubmit. More info - https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/203039204-Tips-for-Excellent-Titles-Descriptions-and-Tags

    For inline styles use: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_inline_style/ and for scripts https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_inline_script/

 5. You should avoid and not to hardcode custom body_class(). Main reason for this is being able to remove the class when needed i.e. child themes.
    What you can do - https://gist.github.com/kailoon/d4d22c9204909dff21eb

    ref: http://themeshaper.com/2014/11/20/mastering-the-post_class-function/ https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/body_class#Add_Classes_By_Filters

    See: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/esc_url

 7. Please make sure your theme doesn't raise any errors or warnings with theme-check. http://envato.d.pr/1djdr/2gvt4VHW

 8. Please make sure you are providing the latest version of the plugins

 9. Please update the TGM Plugin Activation to the latest version, which fixes the security flaw - https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/releases

 10. Please use get_template_directory when including/requiring files. Example(s) from your code and there are more: http://envato.d.pr/1hkhU/19SAy1fH

 12. Page title is missing http://envato.d.pr/1jiLK/2mllnZBk

 14. Directory path should be get_template_directory() and not dirname( FILE ).

 15. Please make sure you properly prepare your data for $wpdb.

     Please also read
     - http://codex.wordpress.org/Data_Validation#Database
     - http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#Protect_Queries_Against_SQL_Injection_Attacks

 17. Please use a unique prefix for all function names, custom images sizes, classes, CONSTANTS, hooks, public/global variables,
     and database entries to avoid conflict issues with plugins and other themes. For example, themename OR frameworkname

     - Read more at http://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/
     - You can have frameworkname if you are using a framework while using themename for your themes

 22. flush_widget_cache() found in the file inc/widgets/widget-woo-categories/widget-woo-categories.php. Deprecated since version 4.4.

 25. The localization file should be in English and delivered as .POT file. .POT will contain all translation strings.

     .POT file name should match the themes-slug.

     Theme can include an actual translation files, but it should not add the en_US.mo or en_US.po because English already implies.

 30. Text domains should be theme-name-based and unique to this theme only. Don't define or use variables. The text domain name must use dashes and not underscores.

     See: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/#text-domains

 31. Data Validation issues have been found in your theme. All dynamic data must be correctly escaped for the context where it is rendered. - All dynamic data must be escaped with esc_attr() before rendered in an html attribute.
     - Whenever you are rendering a url to the screen its value must be passed through esc_url() first. - If dynamic data is rendered inside an attribute that triggers a JavaScript event, it must be escaped with esc_js().

 33. This is not something that a theme should be doing: http://envato.d.pr/13MJm/4xbnedxo And it's also unnecessary: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/comments-are-now-turned-off-on-pages-by-default/

 34. Ordered lists aren't displaying correctly: http://envato.d.pr/10NrB/2lSjYUEz

 35. Logins, registration etc is a plugin-territory functionality: http://envato.d.pr/8RqX/19wU1ehB

 37. Translate all strings within PHP variable and escape where needed. JS and TGMPA included (when/if used). You need to use a text domain to denote all text belonging to that theme.
     The text domain is a unique identifier, which makes sure WordPress can distinguish between all loaded translations. This increases portability and plays better with already existing WordPress tools.
     Any strings within a PHP variable requires to be translated.

 38. Please don't remove core styles: http://envato.d.pr/18L3V/49F1eTlP

 38. Don't hardcode HTTP protocol: http://envato.d.pr/bqKv/2QCiXc54

 40. Slugs, prefixing and text domains should not be a variable, please use a plain text instead.

     http://envato.d.pr/134Fk/3uDDAZLd

 43. To avoid double loading, don't prefix third-party scripts and styles.

     Good: http://envato.d.pr/GSHc/3QuCG8eW

     Not Good: http://envato.d.pr/18sjk/4AzsgXbs

 44. Remove HTTP protocol: http://envato.d.pr/17I6x/1FL7QbyW otherwise HTTPS users will have issues.

 45. Theme needs to properly load files, but also to be consistent as well.

     There are several functions available for getting the path:

     - get_template_directory - Filter the current theme directory path.

     - get_template_directory_uri - Filter the current theme directory URI.

     - get_stylesheet_directory - Filter the stylesheet directory path for current theme.

     - get_stylesheet_directory_uri - Filter the stylesheet directory URI.

     http://envato.d.pr/177Ug/4oDcfErg

 47. Screenshot size should be 1200x900, to account for HiDPI displays. Any 4:3 image size is acceptable, but 1200x900 is preferred. http://envato.d.pr/XTrc

 48. Please make sure your theme doesn't raise any errors or warnings with theme-check. http://envato.d.pr/1kD9Q

 49. No image placeholders, if user doesn't want an image, nothing should display. Theme still needs to work properly without them. http://envato.d.pr/k6CM

 50. Please make sure that your template doesn't raise any PHP errors, notices or warnings. Enabling wp_debug can help you with this. http://envato.d.pr/K2b3

     Note: The screenshots above are examples. There may be more issues that are similar. Make sure to check all files and fix all instances of each issue before resubmitting. Not fixing the issues or fixing them partially will delay your final approval.

 51. It's recommended that your item supports at least PHP5.4, as many WordPress users are on old versions of PHP (https://wordpress.org/about/stats/). If you do not support older versions of PHP your item may get bad ratings and refund requests from buyers.

"It looks like internationalized text strings are not being escaped:

UPDATE your theme to use the following:

No HTML:

        esc_html__( 'String', 'text-domain' );
        esc_html_e( 'String', ’text-domain' );

Some HTML:

        wp_kses( __( 'String <strong>something</strong>', 'text-domain' ), $allowed_html_array );

It's possible for translators to sneak HTML and JS into translation files or even just inadvertently mess something up. So, it's good practice to simply escape them.
